You can pay by wire transfer using this information:

Bank: RecordBank
Name: Neutrinet ASBL
Communication: order n{{ id }} of {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}
IBAN: BE52 6528 3497 8409
BIC: BBRUBEBB

If you wish to pay by other means, please contact us.

It would be great if you could make the transfer quickly as this will allow us to do the order faster.

As soon as your order arrives, we will contact you and inform you about either when we can meet to finish the installation together (it is very likely that this will take place during the next upcoming meeting — every two weeks) or when you can come to grab your components.

If you have any questions, want to modify your order or cancel it, just drop us an email at cube@neutrinet.be

Have a nice day,

<3{% endblocktrans %}
