        %li through this website, you will get to chose your desired components (and optionally subscribe to the Neutrinet VPN service);
        %li as soon as we have enough orders and that everyone has paid, we will make a group order and let you know about the estimated time of arrival;
        %li the indicated price is the bare price without any margin and is the minimal, you are invited to add to it how much you think this service is worth it (and how much you can, 0 is totally acceptable). This is called "free price";
        %li you are invited to pay before the deadline : the sooner everyone has paid, the sooner we can make the order;
        %li once the components arrive, we will let you know when you can come and grab your Cube (and/or components) and, except if you have opted out, finish the configuration with you and explain how to use it.
